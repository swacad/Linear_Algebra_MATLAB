# Linear_Algebra_MATLAB
Linear Algebra Algorithms in M-Script for MATLAB

This repository consists of most of the algorithms implemented for an undergraduate linear algebra course with
UT Austin.

All code contained in the laff folder is not my work.  Credit goes to Robert A. van de Geijn for that code.  Most of the rest of the code are my own implementations of various linear algebra algorithms.  As far as I know, all of the 
algorithms work correctly as all of them have been evaluated for correctness both by code review and testing
using randomly generated matrices and vectors.

Much of the code structure can be generated at http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT501x/Spark/index.html.
However the instructions for each loop iteration must be manually entered.  Using this online application greatly
reduces the potential of making errors in the coding and allows a student to focus on what the algorithm is
supposed to do instead of the fine details of language syntax and correctness.  

It is useful to understand FLAME notation to know how the algorithms work because the typical method of using
indices as we loop through an algorithm have largely been eliminated by partitioning matrices and vectors in
accordance with the FLAME methodology.

A useful reference for this work is "The Science of Programming Matrix Computations" by Robert A. van de Geijn
and Enrique S. Quintana-Orti.  Their outstanding research has made this possible.
