Linear Algebra Algorithms in M-Script for MATLAB

This repository consists of most of the algorithms implemented for an undergraduate linear algebra course with
UT Austin.

Much of the code structure can be generated at http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT501x/Spark/index.html.
However the instructions for each loop iteration must be manually entered.

It is useful to understand FLAME notation to know how the algorithms work because the typical method of using
indices as we loop through an algorithm have largely been eliminated by partitioning matrices and vectors in
accordance with the FLAME methodology.

A useful reference for this work is "The Science of Programming Matrix Computations" by Robert A. van de Geijn
and Enrique S. Quintana-Orti.  Their outstanding research has made this possible.
